The Journey to Web Development

When I first completed my Bachelor's degree in biology, I figured that my only route career wise would be to move towards medical or pharmaceutical school. It was, of course, expected of me to do so, as a south asian first child. I found myself questioning this decision, however, as I began the application process for medical school. All throughout college, I found myself keeping up with tech and fashion to alleviate the burdened feeling biology was giving me. In an aha! moment, I realized that I truly did not want to pursue biology just for the end title to be Dr. So and So. I wanted to study biology because I enjoy biology, but I wanted my career path to intersect with science and tech. I wanted to be able to pursue my creative and artistic passions as far as possible, and by having a career in web development, I can do just that. Six months ago, I really began looking into bootcamp programs and that search lead me to flatiron. And now, six months later, I begin my journey.
